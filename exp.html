                    Wrote 6 programs to represent undirected and weighted directed graphs and perform operations on said graphs, as well as develop a

                    Wrote programs to simulate both a one level and two level computer cache. These programs take in the parameters of the
                    cache including the cache size, the associativity of the cache, the cache replacement policy, and the block size of 
                    the cache, as well as a series of memory addresses. The programs would then output the number of memory reads, memory writes,
                    cache hits, and cache misses of each cache.
